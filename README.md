## 🔮 Future Scope (AI/ML Integration)

While this version focuses on Python-based automation, it is fully adaptable for AI/ML enhancements. Future versions can include:

- **Lead Scoring using ML:** Train a classification model to score leads as Hot/Warm/Cold based on behavior, industry, and engagement.
- **Email Sentiment Analysis (NLP):** Use AI to analyze email replies and classify intent (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Smart Response Suggestion:** Integrate with GPT APIs to generate AI-based reply suggestions for inbound messages.
- **Reply Prediction Model:** Predict the probability of a lead replying based on past campaign data.
- **Opt-in Behavior Analysis:** Cluster similar leads using unsupervised ML based on ICP features and response trends.

> These upgrades can help turn the project into a full AI-driven sales assistant platform.
